# EE112_StopwatchProject
This repository contains a few files we used in the course project we performed for EE112 - Introduction to Electronics as part of which we built an MM:SS digital stopwatch.
We had performed this in Spring 2018.
Files are being uploaded progressively.
The .sqproj files are supposed to be opened using SEQUEL software developed at the Electrical Engineering department of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay.
